A todo list of stuff in no particular order.
	Add a + on the left side of the task when it's been completed.
	Add a - on the left side of the task when you've attempted to do it but can't figure out why it doesnt work.
	Add a ? on the left side of the task when you think the task is a debatable in terms of whether it should be completed at all.

DONE:
+antlions being able jump when in the thumpers push radius
+antlions being able burrow when in the thumper's general radius
+antlions being unable to move when burrowed near thumper
+prediction problems with burrowing
+speed up burrowed movement for antlions
+make a working mounted turret for maps to replace func_tank since they won't work in multiplayer

ATTEMPTED:
-EXPERIENCING MAJOR FPS DROP WHEN BURROWED
-antlions not doing damage on landing
-player rendering problems
-make impact effects under the antlions feet when it lands/moves
-make thumper resistance higher as players get closer, but not truly stopping them - also make it harder to see as they get closer

IDEAS:
design a progress system
add a melee attack to guns that does a push-back
maybe make an ambush attack for antlions where they can pull rebels into the sand when burrowed?
maybe add an incapacitation system like L4D?
disable shooting while sprinting for rebels - maybe make their weapon lower too?


TODO:
redo antlion controls - these are my ideas.
	melee	.	primary
	melee2	.	secondary?
	pounce	.	primary + sprint?
	charge	.	secondary + sprint?
	roar	.	reload
	burrow	.	crouch
	vision	.	flashlight?
make a custom team selection panel
make a better hud
make a results screen
add gib explosions for when antlions get killed
add battle zone volume support
add model clipping for when antlions are burrowing?
add view punch for rebels when hit by antlion attacks
add screen shivering for rebels when an antlion roars at them
add pinned status for rebels when antlions pounce/land on them
add subtle rumbling for rebels when burrowing antlions are near
add sand-shooting for burrowed antlions
add a dynamic damage system for rebels where damage to certain body parts makes certain abilities less effective.
decide how scoring works for each team
script antlion workers
script the antlion guard
script the antlion guardian
finish scripting campaign mode
script survival mode
script scavenge mode
script extraction mode
move some of the keyvalues/inputs/outputs from some ents to another?
	the time fraction keys from logic_antlion battle could be a completely different logic ent
	the configuration keys from ENTITY_EVENTS_CLASS could also be a completely different logic ent
make it so burrowing out starts at frame 10 in the sequence.
disable team killing
render a visual ring to represent thumper radiuses for antlions
script the start-burrowed aspect of spawning


BUGS:
burrow logic not working
	it should seem like there's a physical barrier wherever movement is meant to stop
	traces shouldn't be allowing the player to get past a point where they need to move back to ply.LastValidPos
antlions being able to see blood decals from first person view
	this is because we are drawing the local player to get their shadow
	is there some way we could not draw local player, but get their shadow?
rebel shadows not appearing correctly - narwhal
antlion attack animations not resetting frames before playing
antlions freezing when damaged
entity resetting and team flipping on round change
spawn selection doesn't appear to work as intended
gravgun flipping antlions doesn't work
