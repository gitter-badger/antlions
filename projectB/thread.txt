Antlion Survival

Antlion Survival is a bit of a side-project. It's a team-based gamemode where you can play as a Rebel Survivor or an Antlion.

[b]So it's exactly like Zombie Survival but with antlions?[b]
No. It has more of an L4D twist to it. It doesn't follow the same game mechanics that you might have seen in ZS.

[b]Can you play as antlions and all their different types like workers and guards?[/b]
Yes. There will be times where you can play as an Antlion Worker, Antlion Guard, and even the Antlion Guardian.

[b]What can each team do?[/b]
Aside from the normal attacks that antlions can perform, they also have the ability to burrow and fly.
They also have the element of surprise. They could be anywhere: high above on a cliff, or strategically positioned to ambush from underground.
Rebels have technology on their side. Rebels have a wide array of equipment to combat antlion swarms.
Aside from their standard rebel weapons, they have cool gadgets such as miniature thumpers to deploy in emergencies, allied rollermines/hoppermines/landmines, and combine turrets.

[b]Game Premise:[/b]
During the war on the Combine, many rebels found refuge in the deserts and coastlines outside of Nova Prospekt. Unfortunately, no one told them there would be an antlion problem.

[b]Won't this get boring after a while?[/b]
Everything gets boring eventually, but to keep interest, this gamemode will come with four different modes.

Campaign
	Rebels must cross an antlion-infested map to the next rebel camp.
Survival
	Rebels must survive until an extraction team arrives.
Scavenge
	Rebels must journy outside the safety of their thumpers to rerieve batteries to keep the thumpers powered.
Extraction
	Rebels must infiltrate the antlion hive and retrieve the extract.
