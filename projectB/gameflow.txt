Campaign
	
EARLY GAME:
	First rebel spawns:
		Pre-Game timer starts.
		Spawn area is closed off for pre-game timer.
	Rebels spawn in their spawn area:
		Antlions are on hold, but have the option to choose where they spawn.
	Pre-Game timer ends:
		Spawn area opens up.
		Rebels leave spawn area.
	First rebel sets off trigger to game start.
		Antlion spawning is activated.
MID GAME:
	Rebels campaign and survive.
	Rebels set off triggers for progress/antlion spawns and battles.
BATTLES:
	Rebels set off battle zone triggers.
	Timed:
		Majority of rebels will probably need to pass a trigger_satisfy.
		Rebels survive antlion spawning.
		Battle ends when timer runs out and exit opens up.
	Triggered:
		Likely set up as a long field to rush though, or a form of obstacle to escape.
		All rebels will probably need to pass a trigger_satisfy to end it.
		Rebels escape and battle ends.
	Either:
		Both or the above hold true. The battle either ends when rebels escape, or when a timer runs out.
END GAME:
	All rebels pass a trigger_satisfy, game ends with a rebel victory result.
